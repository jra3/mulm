# Breeders Award Program

The Breeders Award Program (BAP) of the Brooklyn Aquarium Society measures advancement in aquaristics by recognizing members who successfully reproduce aquatic species. The program encourages participation, acknowledges achievements, and promotes sharing of breeding techniques. It is noncompetitive, recognizing all members based on their experimentation and willingness to learn, regardless of setup size or time constraints. All points earned are cumulative.

## Points & Awards

Points are awarded for each successful spawn, based on a point classification list. Accumulated points lead to various titles and awards.

# Breeder of the Year Award

 An annual award that is presented to the hobbyist who has bred the most fish, plants  
and/or coral propagation and, in the view of the BAP committee, has demonstrated a  
devotion to the expanding of the species through generosity, patience and support of the  
club. Examples are donating fry to other members, help and support to other breeders and  
support to the BAS. The BAP chairperson reserves the right not to present this award if it is  
believed that no one person has shown the qualities and characteristics that set them apart  
from other hobbyists.

# Claiming Points

## General Rules

* You must be a member in good standing with BAS.
* Points may be awarded to families/couples or to individuals, but not to both.
* It is the breeder's responsibility to complete all necessary forms and ensure submissions are properly recorded.
* Points may be obtained only once per species of fish/coral invertebrate/plant.
  * If a fish has been reclassified under a different scientific name, it will not count as a new species. E.g. Bristlenose Pleco being reclassified (Ancistrus temminckii to Ancistrus cirrhosus)
  * Color variations do not count as a separate species. E.g. Discus varieties Symphysodon aequifasciatus "Pigeon Blood" and Symphysodon aequifasciatus "Gold Dragon" do not count as separate species.

## Submission Process

### 1. Submit Online Form
After successful breeding/propagation, submit your report online at [bap.basny.org](https://bap.basny.org). Include:
* Species information and reproduction details
* Tank parameters and breeding conditions
* Photos or video links of offspring (highly recommended)

### 2. Admin Screening
A program admin will review your submission for completeness and credibility. This is **not** an in-person home visit - admins review based on the information and photos/videos you provide.

### 3. Mature Your Offspring
After admin screening approval, raise your offspring to demonstrate viability:

* **Fish (Freshwater)**: Raise at least 6 healthy fry for 60 days from free-swimming
* **Fish (Marine)**: Raise at least 6 healthy fry for 30 days from free-swimming (marine fish are more difficult and receive 20 points minimum)
* **Plants**: Ensure successful propagation growth for 60 days
  * Acceptable methods: cuttings, offshoots, runners, plantlets with independent root systems, flowering, or seed production
  * Floating plants: doubling the amount
  * Bunch plants: doubling the number of rooted growing stems
  * Runner/divided plants: one healthy plant capable of living independently
* **Corals**: Ensure successful propagation growth for 60 days

**Special Consideration**: For fish that are less prolific, or for Junior members, the committee may waive the 6-fish minimum upon request.

### 4. Bring to Monthly Auction
After the maturation period, bring your offspring to a Brooklyn Aquarium Society monthly meeting/auction to present them. **Points are awarded at the meeting** when you physically present the offspring to a program admin.

**What to Bring**:
* At least 6 healthy fry (for fish) that meet the age requirements
* Propagated plants or coral frags that demonstrate successful growth
* The offspring should be in good health and match the species you submitted

### 5. Receive Points
A program admin will verify your offspring at the meeting and award points. Points are recorded immediately and contribute to your award level progression.

## Important Notes

* You do **not** need a home visit for verification
* Admins screen submissions based on photos, videos, and credibility
* The maturation period (30-60 days) ensures offspring viability before points are awarded
* Bringing offspring to the auction supports the club and lets other members see your success! 

# Assigning & Challenging Points

* Species not already listed in program points lists that an aquarist is planning to spawn should be brought to the Chairperson’s attention. The Chairperson will present the specifics to the committee for discussion. The committee, by majority vote, will assign points.  
* It is recognized that new discoveries, new importations of fish, published documents, etc. can all change the value of breeding a specific species. Points may therefore be reviewed and changed periodically by the committee, by majority vote, and the findings and changes will be publicized in the club journal “Aquatica.”  
* If the number of points is changed on a species, this point value will go into effect immediately. When points are reclassified, the points shall not be applied to previously earned points.  
* The Breeder Award Program year will start in September and end at the July Board meeting. Spawns for July and August will be recognized in September.  
* If a member has a lapse in membership, the former club member’s points will be reinstated depending on the availability of records. During the period of time the person was not a member, those spawns will not count for points; points will start again upon the person becoming a member in good standing.  
* The BAP committee has the right to extend any time and/or date limits.

### Point Leveling

Many factors may be considered when the committee chooses the points to be awarded for a species

1. Fish, coral invertebrate, plant type  
2. Water chemistry, lighting, temperature  
3. Feeding requirements  
4. Difficulty in spawning  
5. Difficulty in raising fry

Basic guidelines for the levels are as follows.

**5 points** \- Species that can basically breed over a wide range of conditions, all by themselves.

Examples: guppy and platy.

**10 points** \- Species that can be bred easily, given specific conditions, which are not too  
exacting. 

Examples: barbs which breed easily when conditioned properly, zebras when  
conditioned and given low water level and a marble bottomed tank or African mbuna which  
breed easily given alkaline water, good food and some measure of protection  
against aggression.

**15 points** \- Those species which may present moderate problems in one or more of the  
following areas: aggressive behavior, water chemistry , specific diet requirements, mate selection  
or sexing, poor physical stamina or disease resistance, special tank setup requirements, special  
care for fry.

Example: Angelfish- may present a sexing problem, have an aggressive nature,  
and can present a problem providing proper brood care.

**20 points** \- Those fish that have not been bred, bred only very rarely, or are very difficult to  
breed based on the severity of the problems mentioned above.

Examples: Black Ghost fish, Neons, and all marine species.

# The Awards Committee

• The Award Committee will consist of a chairperson and an even number of other  
members. The chairperson and the members shall be approved and appointed by the Board  
of Directors.

• The duties of the committee shall be to witness spawning and cuttings, keep official  
records and point totals, report to the Board when necessary, publicize the activities of the  
committee and those persons spawning fish in the club journal, order certificates and awards  
as needed, and make the necessary presentations at meetings.

* As soon as your fish spawn, plant or coral reproduce call/email:
