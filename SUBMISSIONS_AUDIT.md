## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix Typo in Database**
   - Add "Xenotaca doadrioi" as synonym for "Xenotoca doadrioi"
   - This affects 3 submissions

2. **Review Point Corrections**
   - Total points adjustment needed: ~150 points across all members
   - Ancistrus cirrhosus: Change from 15 to 20 pts (2 submissions)
   - Many over-awarded points on various species

3. **Add Missing Species**
   - Plants: Vallisneria, Rotala rotundifolia, Najas guadalupensis
   - Corals: Need to determine if coral submissions are allowed in BAP
   - Complete species names for "Ancistrus" entries

4. **CARES Status Review**
   - Verify Poecilia velifera CARES status
   - Update Rohanella Titteya (Cherry Barb) CARES marking

### Data Quality Issues:

1. **Incomplete Species Names**: Some submissions have only genus (e.g., "Ancistrus", "Discosoma")
2. **Mixed Programs**: Appears to have coral/plant submissions mixed with fish
3. **Name Variations**: Need better matching logic for synonyms and common misspellings

## Members Most Affected

1. **Don Lang**: 11 submissions with issues
2. **David Manuel**: 7 submissions with issues
3. **Denis Vardaro**: 4 submissions with issues
4. **John Allen**: 2 submissions with issues
5. **Steve Matassa**: 4 submissions with issues

## Database Integrity Check

Species in database: 2,302 groups
