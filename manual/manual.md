# [cite_start]Brooklyn Aquarium Society: Breeder & Horticultural Awards Program Manual (Revised 2009) 

## [cite_start]Welcome to the Breeders Award Program (BAP) of the Brooklyn Aquarium Society 

[cite_start]The purpose of the Breeders Award Program (BAP) is to measure our advancement as aquarists as we gain the knowledge and skill to allow the species we keep to reproduce. [cite_start]The program's goals are to encourage participation among members, recognize outstanding achievements, and share knowledge of breeding techniques. [cite_start]This is a noncompetitive program that recognizes all members equally based on their ability and willingness to experiment, without time limits or regard to the size of their setup. [cite_start]All earned points are cumulative over an indefinite period.

## [cite_start]Breeder Of The Year Award 

[cite_start]This is an annual award presented to the hobbyist who has bred the most fish, plants, and/or corals. [cite_start]The BAP committee also considers the member's devotion to expanding species through generosity, patience, and support of the club. [cite_start]The BAP chairperson has the right to not present the award if no one is believed to have shown the required qualities.

---

## [cite_start]Claiming Points 

* [cite_start]You must be a member in good standing with BAS.
* [cite_start]A spawn must be "witnessed" by a BAP committee member, who will inspect the fry and parents within 7 days of them becoming free swimming. [cite_start]A revisit is required after 60 days to verify the fry are still alive, or the fry can be brought to a club meeting.
* [cite_start]A minimum of six (6) fry maintained for 60 days is considered a spawn.
* [cite_start]For marine fish, they are considered 20-point fish if the fry are free swimming for 30 days.
* [cite_start]For corals and plants, a committee member must inspect the "cutting" within 7 days and revisit within 60 days to determine reasonable growth.
* [cite_start]All requirements must be completed within 4 months after the initial witnessing, or the spawn is not eligible.
* [cite_start]Points may only be obtained once per species of fish, coral, invertebrate, or plant. [cite_start]Color variations do not count as separate species, but a different Latin name does.
* [cite_start]It is the breeder's responsibility to complete and submit all forms and verify that points are recorded correctly.
* [cite_start]Points may be awarded to families or individuals, but not to both.

---

## [cite_start]Assigning & Challenging Points 

* [cite_start]For species not on the list, the Chairperson will present the specifics to the committee, which will assign points by majority vote.
* [cite_start]Point values may be reviewed and changed periodically by the committee, with changes publicized in the club journal "Aquatica". [cite_start]Changes go into effect immediately and are not applied retroactively.
* [cite_start]The BAP year starts in September and ends at the July Board meeting. [cite_start]Spawns from July and August are recognized in September.
* [cite_start]If a membership lapses, points may be reinstated depending on record availability, but no points are awarded for spawns that occurred during the lapse.
* [cite_start]The BAP committee has the right to extend any time and/or date limits.

### Rationale for Assigning Points

The assigning of points is based on:
1.  [cite_start]Fish, coral, invertebrate, or plant type.
2.  [cite_start]Water chemistry, lighting, and temperature needs.
3.  [cite_start]Feeding requirements.
4.  [cite_start]Difficulty in spawning.
5.  [cite_start]Difficulty in raising fry.

* [cite_start]**5 points:** Species that breed over a wide range of conditions by themselves (e.g., guppy, platy).
* [cite_start]**10 points:** Species that are bred easily given specific, non-exacting conditions (e.g., barbs, African mbuna).
* [cite_start]**15 points:** Species presenting moderate problems in areas like aggression, water chemistry, diet, or fry care (e.g., Angelfish).
* [cite_start]**20 points:** Species that have been bred only rarely or are very difficult to breed (e.g., Black Ghost fish, Neons, all marine species).

## [cite_start]Breeders Award Committee 

* [cite_start]The committee consists of a chairperson and an even number of other members, appointed by the Board of Directors.
* [cite_start]Duties include witnessing spawns/cuttings, keeping records, reporting to the Board, publicizing activities, ordering awards, and making presentations.
* [cite_start]To report a spawn, plant, or coral reproduction, members should contact the Committee Chairperson, Joe Graffagnino, or other listed committee members.
